            <i>Chazal</i> designed berachos very precisely. Each <i>bracha’s</i> length, text, and even number of words and letters, is by design, laced with tremendous depth and symbolism.
            <br /><br />
            Some berachos are concise, like <i>birchos hamitzvos</i> (blessings over commandments) and <i>birchos hanehenin</i> (blessings over pleasures). Perhaps Chazal knew that our eagerness to shake the lulav and our salivating tongues wouldn’t allow for anything longer.
            <br /><br />
            On the opposite side of the spectrum, some berachos are very lengthy, like the <i>beracha</i>-marathon of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>. Clearly in this instance, brevity was not a consideration <i>Chazal</i> factored in when taking close audience with Hashem and asking Him of our needs.
            <br /><br />
            However, there’s a small contingency of berachos which don’t quite fit the bill as being “one-liner” <i>berachos</i>, nor are they in the same class as the verbose <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>.
            <br /><br />
            It’s a unique category of <i>berachos</i> which, upon a cursory glance, would seem to demand a decent amount of time commitment and visual attention, but because of the circumstance under which they are recited, they lend themselves to be said quickly and by heart.
            <br /><br />
            The prime examples of this category are <i>berachos</i> like <i>Birchas HaMazon (benching), Al HaMichya, Asher Yatzar, and Tefillas HaDerech</i>.
            <br /><br />
            Concentrating on <i>Birchas HaMazon</i> and <i>Al Hamichya</i> without reading from the text throughout the din of a busy restaurant is no piece of cake.
            Nor is reciting <i>Asher Yatzar</i> while furtively standing beside the restroom door with eyes darting in every which direction.
            <br /><br />
            And saying <i>Tefillas HaDerech</i> while doing 80 on the highway simply isn’t the way to go.
            <br /><br />
            How then can we find a way to give these <i>berachos</i> the attention they deserve?
